- Filter set of haplotypes based on gaps in read depth.
- Remove `bio` dependency.
- `add`: allow FASTA input.
- WFA: Stop very bad alignments.
- `draw_depth`: handle repeated genotypes.
- Read depth estimation: underestimating variance at low subsampling rates.
- Count edit distance only within the region of interest!
- What to do with read pairs where one of the mates is unmapped?
- Check if alt alleles have Ns. Discard missing haplotypes
